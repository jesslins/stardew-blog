          This is my current farm in Stardew Valley! It doesn't look as great
          as it usually does since it is currently Winter in the game, and there
          are no crops growing, but I spent a lot of time and put in a lot of
          effort to design it, and I'm proud of how it looks! I'll try to update
          this image every in-game season so the image stays current.

            The Screenshot takes place in the Winter season. On the left side, 
            there is a Deluxe Coop, as well as a Deluxe Barn. In the top left, 
            there is a greenhouse, with two silos beside it. There are two
            Junimo Huts surrounded by 8 5x5 farming spots. Around the top center,
            there's a mill and a shed. Beside the shed is a stable, which is
            beside a fully upgraded farmhouse. In front of the shed is 26
            perserves jars that are placed in the shape of a crescent moon. In 
            the top right, there is a Water Obliesk and an Earth Obliesk. Around
            the bottom center is a fish pond, and around the right center is 18
            bee houses."
