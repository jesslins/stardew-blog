          blue, the sky is littered with stars."

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome! If you're reading this, you've somehow stumbled upon the
          website where I've decided to talk about a game called Stardew Valley!
          I got into this game around March 2021 (I believe), and ever since
          I've been absolutely addicted to it. It's a great game, very calming
          (aside from certain stressful parts which I honestly find fun), and a
          great way to spend your time if you don't have anything else to do!
          Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to play for the past few weeks
          because of school, but hopefully I'll find the time to play again soon
          :]

        <h2>What is Stardew Valley?</h2>
        <p>
          "Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You've inherited
          your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with
          hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new
          life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown
          fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja
          Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but
          disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of
          activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of
          opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to
          restore Stardew Valley to greatness!" (Stardew Valley Wiki)

          "Stardew Valley is a simulation role-playing video game developed by
          Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take the role of a character who
          takes over their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place
          known as Stardew Valley. The game was released for Windows in February
          2016 before being ported to several other computer, console, and
          mobile platforms. Stardew Valley is open-ended, allowing players to
          take on activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, fishing,
          cooking, mining and foraging, and socializing with the townspeople,
          including the ability to marry and have children. It also allows up to
          four players to play online together." (Wikipedia)
