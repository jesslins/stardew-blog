          are three trees in the foreground. Two of the trees are in the 
          bottom corners, and one is right in the bottom center. There are 
          three clouds behind the mountains, all of them directly above and
          behind the three trees. The top of the sky is a dark blue, while 
          slowly fading to a lighter blue near the bottom. Along the darker
          blue, the sky is littered with stars."

        <!--Heading for the paragraph where I talk about Penny-->
        <h2>Penny</h2>
        <p>
          Penny is definitely my favorite character so far! She's very sweet, and extremely caring. 
          Throughout the game, you can see that she has gone through a lot, and I believe that she
          deserves so much more than she has gotten. She's amazing with Jas and Vincent, and I hope
          that her life will get better soon.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!--Heading for the paragraph where I talk about Leah-->
        <h2>Leah</h2>
        <p>
          Leah is my second-favorite character. She's very kind, creative, and a great person in
          general. I've always had a liking towards artistic people, and I look up to them, and Leah
          is exactly that. There are many adorable cutscenes with Leah and your character where she
          teaches you how to paint, or gives you art that she has made for you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!--Heading for the paragraph where I talk about Haley-->
        <h2>Maru</h2>
        <p>
          Maru is my third-favorite character. She's adorable, shy, and nerdy. Maru is extremely
          intelligent, she works as a nurse at the town's clinic, has a large interest in
          science, taking after her dad. She enjoys robotics, astronomy, and helping her father
          out in his laboratory.
